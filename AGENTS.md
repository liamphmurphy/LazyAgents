# Vesper: notes for agents

## Trying Vesper in a playground

To let the person click through a change (UI or API), start a playground with
`start_playground` instead of describing how to run it. Run Vesper in
**no sign-in mode** (`VESPER_NO_SIGNIN=1`). A playground can't do the normal
sign-in: `make signin` needs a shell the person doesn't have, and the
playground gateway keeps the `vesper_session` cookie for the outer Vesper.

}
```

- Keep the `/` route: a path no route matches goes to the first process,
  which is `api`, so without it the pages come from the Go API.
- `VESPER_NO_SIGNIN=1` serves the API as the seeded local user with no
  session. The API refuses to start with it unless `PUBLIC_URL` is a
  loopback address, which the default (`http://localhost:8080`) is. Never set
  it anywhere but a disposable local instance.
- Leave `SECRETS_KEY` unset: secrets are then off, which a throwaway instance
  doesn't need.
- The inner Vesper has a runner (`vesper runner`, fake backend), started in
  the api container once the API is healthy: a process needs a port, and the
  runner listens on none. Its `claude` and `codex` are the repository's
  `fake-harness`, so chats get canned replies through the real MCP path and
  no credentials enter the playground. Change `FAKE_HARNESS_MODE` for other
  scripts (see `server/cmd/fake-harness/main.go`).
- Wrap each setup command in `( … )` so a `cd` stays inside it, and keep each
  process's `dir` one that already exists: Docker creates a missing one as
  root, and nothing can write there afterwards.
- The first start compiles the API and starts `next dev`, which takes a few
  minutes. Call `playground_status` until it's running, and read `log` if it
  failed.

## Export and import (adding tables and buckets)

`vesper export` / `vesper import` (`server/internal/transfer`) move a whole
instance. They read the Postgres catalog and the S3 bucket listing, so **a new
table or bucket is exported with no code change**. Don't add it to a list.

- To keep a table out (a cache, a session, anything tied to this machine), add
  it to `excluded` in `server/internal/transfer/schema.go` **with the reason**.
  `TestEveryTableIsExportedOrExcluded` fails for a table that is neither.
- Foreign-key cycles are handled by deferring one key; a new cycle needs nothing.
- A migration that rewrites existing rows works on imported data too: import
  loads rows at the archive's schema version, then runs the newer migrations.
- A new bucket needs nothing, but add it to the `S3_BUCKETS` default so export
  finds it on stores that won't list buckets.
- The real-store test runs when `TEST_S3_ENDPOINT` is set (dev compose
  SeaweedFS); the rest run on `TEST_DATABASE_URL` alone.
